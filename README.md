Deisgn of a Distance Relay for a IEEE/WECC-9 bus test system.

In this project, I engineered a Mho relay utilizing SIMULINK within an IEEE/WECC-9 bus test system. The design of the relay included the ability to detect LG, LL, LLG, and LLL faults, which made sure that all fault scenarios were fully protected. Validation encompassed testing across all three protective zones to confirm functionality.

Additionally, the model underwent rigorous evaluation under diverse load conditions, encompassing both first and second-quadrant operations. Simulation of power swings enabled the assessment of stability characteristics, ensuring robust performance during dynamic events.

* Further enhancements were achieved through the integration of numerical algorithms, augmenting the relay's capabilities in signal processing and fault detection. Utilizing current transformers to simulate current and voltage measurements, mimic filters made it easier to remove DC offset.

Testing encompassed a suite of algorithms, including the Maan-Morrison forward, central, and backward algorithms, alongside the Rockefeller-Udern and Fourier full cycle algorithms. This comprehensive validation process ensured the relay's reliability and effectiveness across a spectrum of operational
scenerios.
